 Lagrange Four Square Theorem:
 	This basically tells us that any number can be broken into maximum of 4 squares. So, by default this is our answer. we need to check if we have a solution with 3 or 2 or 1 squares. There can be a 3-square solution if and only if we can’t write n in the form 4^k(8m+7) for integers k and m. If a number itself is a perfect square number then numbers of square is 1. Otherwise we can try break the number into 2 squares i and j such that n=i*i+j*j, for any i, 1≤i≤√n. So, for any natural positive number there are only 4 possible results: 1, 2, 3, 4.
